# 🧮 Stack Based Calculator (Streamlit Dashboard)

A modern **Stack-Based Calculator Web App** built using **Python and Streamlit**.
This project demonstrates the use of **Data Structures (Stack concept)** to perform arithmetic operations through an interactive **web dashboard**.

The calculator provides a clean UI, real-time calculations, and maintains a history of operations.

# 🧠 How the Stack Concept Works

This calculator follows the **stack principle used in expression evaluation**.

Basic workflow:

1. User inputs numbers and operators.
2. Expression is built dynamically.
3. When `=` is pressed:

   * The expression is evaluated.
4. Result is displayed and stored in history.

Stack-based calculators are widely used in:

* Compilers
* Expression parsing
* Mathematical interpreters

# 📜 Example Calculation

```
Input:
88 ÷ 11

Output:
8.0
```

History will display:

```
88/11 = 8.0
```
